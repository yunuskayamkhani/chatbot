# Chatbot Training and Deployment

This repository contains code for training and deploying a chatbot using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models.

## Features

- **Training Script (`train_chatbot.py`)**: Preprocesses data, trains a deep learning model using Keras, and saves the trained model and tokenizer files.
- **Chatbot Response Script (`chatbot_response.py`)**: Loads the trained model and preprocessed data to predict responses based on user input.
- **GUI Interface (`chat_gui.py`)**: Provides a graphical user interface using Tkinter for interactive chatbot conversations.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `nltk`
- `numpy`
- `keras`
- `tensorflow`
- `tkinter` (for GUI)
